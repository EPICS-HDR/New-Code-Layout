          Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a reservation in North and South Dakota
          known as the birthplace of prominent Native American civil rights
          activist Sitting Bull, and are committed to protecting the language,
          culture and well-being of its people through economic development,
          technology advancement, community engagement and education. Their
          overall mission is to create a website for the residents, as well as
          anyone interested in accessing data collected from the reservation.
          Being able to track climate change and relationships between their
          crop output and the weather is important for their economy and
          well-being as a tribe.

          EPICS HDR (Harnessing Data Revolution) is a team within the EPICS
           program, a service-learning initiative where students collaborate 
           with communities to design solutions for human, environmental, and 
           societal challenges. The HDR team develops interactive, user-friendly 
           dashboards that synthesize complex environmental datasets into 
           accessible visualizations. By integrating historical and real-time 
           information, their platforms empower communities to analyze trends, 
           monitor resources, and make data-driven decisions. Through the 
           empowerment of the EPICS program, the HDR teamsâ€™ goals are to support 
           sustainable practices and economic resilience using technology. EPICS 
           HDR focuses on merging technical expertise with community-centered design, 
           creating partnerships that bridge technology and real-world impact while 
           equipping Purdue students with skills to address real-world challenges.
